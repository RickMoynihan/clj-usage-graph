# clj-usage-graph

A Clojure library that emits usage diagrams for your project.

![Example](g.svg)

## Caveats

1. It will load all the source files you give it, so beware of any top-level side-effects.
2. It doesn't reflect macro usage at all. Any macros in your project
   will appear unused, as only the expanded code is analyzed.
3. There are some sorts of code it doesn't work on, which is either a problem with the
   analyzer lib or this lib's use of it; either way I'd like all such things fixed.

## Obtention

Leiningen coordinates:

``` clojure
[com.gfredericks/clj-usage-graph "0.2.0"]
```

## Usage

Make sure you have graphviz installed and thus the `dot` command
available; then:

```
find src -type f | \
xargs lein run -m com.gfredericks.clj-usage-graph/generate | \
dot -Tsvg -o g.svg
```
